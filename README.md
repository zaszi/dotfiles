# Dotfiles

Zaszi's collection of personal dotfiles and various userland configuration files.

## Usage

This repository contains my dotfiles. No bootstrap scripts of installation tools are included. I deploy these to my machines using Ansible.

Whether you fork this repository, utilize snippets of my configuration or merely browse for ideas is up to you. See below for features, screenshots and further documentation.

## Features

* [Alacritty](#Alacritty)

### Alacritty

* **Repository:** https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty
* **Description:** A cross-platform, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator.
* **Config location:** `~/.config/alacritty`
* **Dependencies:** Iosevka Nerd Font

Alacritty is fast, lightweight and comes with Wayland support out-of-the-box. My particular setup comes with slight transparency, the [Gruvbox Dark](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) colorscheme and the [Iosevka Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/).
